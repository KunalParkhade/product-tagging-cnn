# 🏷️ Product Tagging with CNN - Unlock the Power of Automated Tagging!

Welcome to the **Product Tagging with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** project! 🚀 Imagine having an AI-powered system that automatically tags your product images for e-commerce, saving you tons of time and effort. That’s exactly what this project is all about.

## 📖 What Is This Project?

This project builds an AI model using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to automate the process of tagging product images. Whether you're an e-commerce enthusiast or just curious about deep learning, this project is a great hands-on example of how you can train models to **classify images** and predict product categories.

### 🎯 Key Highlights:
- **🔥 Powerful CNN Architecture**: Leveraging the capabilities of CNN for image classification.
- **📊 90.13% Accuracy**: Achieved after training on just 2 epochs!
- **🔄 Fully Automated**: From loading the data to making predictions.

## 🛠️ How to Get Started

Excited to try it out? Here's how you can dive right into it:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KunalParkhade/product-tagging-cnn.git
   ```
2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd product-tagging-cnn
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Once you're set up, you can open the Jupyter Notebook (`Product_Tagging.ipynb`) and start running the cells!

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

This project is structured to guide you through the entire process of building an AI model for product tagging:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: We start by loading and preprocessing product images.
2. **Building the CNN**: The core of this project is a **Convolutional Neural Network** designed to recognize patterns in images.
3. **Training the Model**: Watch the magic happen as the model learns to classify product images.
4. **Testing & Results**: Finally, evaluate the model’s performance. Spoiler alert: it achieves a solid 90.13% accuracy! 🏆

## 🚀 Want to Try It Out Yourself?

Follow the steps in the notebook to:
- Load your dataset
- Train the CNN on your data
- Evaluate the model’s predictions

You'll see just how effective CNNs are at recognizing patterns and classifying images. Plus, it's easy to tweak the model parameters (like batch size, number of epochs) if you're feeling adventurous.

## 📈 Results & Performance

After just 2 epochs of training, our CNN model reaches an impressive **90.13% accuracy** on the test set. And that’s only the beginning! There are plenty of ways to enhance this project, from experimenting with more advanced architectures to fine-tuning hyperparameters.

## 👩‍💻 Why Should You Star This Repo?

- **Hands-on learning**: If you're new to deep learning or image classification, this is a perfect project to get your hands dirty!
- **Real-world application**: Product tagging is widely used in e-commerce and retail—this project could be a stepping stone for similar solutions.
- **Engaging**: Who doesn’t want to see a model they built correctly classify images?

Go ahead, ⭐ **star this repo** and start exploring! Your contribution and feedback are always welcome.

## 🔮 Future Directions

We’ve built the foundation, but there’s so much more you can do:
- 🧠 Try more advanced models like **ResNet** or **EfficientNet**.
- 🎛️ Experiment with different hyperparameters or data augmentation techniques.
- 🏷️ Use this model to build an actual product-tagging app for an e-commerce platform.
